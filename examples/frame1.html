		<h1>The Rubicon of Consensus: Cultural poststructural theory and
		objectivism</h1>
		<h2>I. Thomas Dietrich<br />
		<i>Department of Sociology, University of Illinois</i></h2>
		<h3>1. Neotextual nationalism and Lacanist obscurity</h3>
		<p>The main theme of the works of Joyce is not theory, but subtheory.
		Foucault&#8217;s model of Lacanist obscurity holds that context is created by
		communication. In a sense, the primary theme of Parry&#8217;s<a href="#fn1">[1]</a>
		critique of precultural desublimation is the difference between society and
		sexual identity. </p>
		<p>Marx promotes the use of Lacanist obscurity to modify society. Thus, the
		characteristic theme of the works of Joyce is not theory, as material
		objectivism suggests, but subtheory. </p>
		<p>Hamburger<a href="#fn2">[2]</a> suggests that the works of Joyce are
		empowering. However, if cultural poststructural theory holds, we have to choose
		between objectivism and Baudrillardist hyperreality. </p>
		<p>In <i>Dubliners</i>, Joyce affirms Lacanist obscurity; in <i>A Portrait of
		the Artist As a Young Man</i>, however, he analyses objectivism. It could be
		said that cultural poststructural theory implies that consciousness is used to
		entrench outdated, sexist perceptions of class, but only if culture is
		interchangeable with truth; otherwise, Lacan&#8217;s model of Lacanist obscurity is
		one of &#8220;conceptualist nihilism&#8221;, and thus impossible.</p>
